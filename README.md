# Some YouTube client that uses Tor Network as proxy server

This first version, so up text is not true at this context
To run tor client begin into ```Tor Browser``` and run command ```tor -f Data/torrc```.
Not good, yes? (But for now, i guess)
After that open ```main.py```, like that: ```python main.py```
And done (for now)
